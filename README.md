### Welcome!

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub. I have some repositories here for most of my resources for the sake of putting it in one place. I'm the main dev of the Python package [pyUtau](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/pyUtau) and the UTAU resampler [straycat-rs](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/straycat-rs). I also maintain [some scripts](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/nnsvslabeling) to help in developing [ENUNU](https://github.com/oatsu-gh/ENUNU) databases. I also have a [script](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/nnsvs-db-converter) for converting NNSVS databases into [DiffSinger](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger) databases! I have other AI SVS things lying around there but that's about it!

### About me

Hi... again. I'm UtaUtaUtau, better known as Uta because my username begs to be abbreviated. I come from the Philippines and I go by he/they pronouns. I like using vocalsynths because I like singing robots :)

I'm entirely self-taught when it comes to programming so I don't really know what the best practices are sometimes... I do know Python, Java, JavaScript and Rust, but I mostly use Python and Rust. I've also used Lua, Go, C, and C++ at least once in my life but I forgot most of it already.
