# UtaUtaUtau

### Welcome!

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub. I have some repositories in here that are usually just forks of vocal synth stuff... I'm the sole creator of the Python package [pyUtau](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/pyUtau). I also maintain [some scripts](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/nnsvslabeling) to help in developing [ENUNU](https://github.com/oatsu-gh/ENUNU) databases. I have some other ENUNU things lying around there but that's about it!

### About me

Hi... again. I'm UtaUtaUtau, better known as Uta because my username begs to be abbreviated. I come from the Philippines and I go by he/they pronouns. I like using vocalsynths because I like singing robots :)

I'm entirely self-taught when it comes to programming so I don't really know what the best practices are sometimes... I do know Python, Lua, C, C++, Go, Java, and JavaScript but I mostly use Python.
